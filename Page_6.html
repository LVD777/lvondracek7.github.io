      The purpose of this project was to analyze the weather
      changes as you get close to the equator. To accomplish this 
      analysis, we first pulled the data from the OpenWeatherMap API
      to assemble a dataset on over 500 cities,

        After assembling the data set, we used Matplotlib to plot
        various aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked 
        at included:temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity. This site provides the source 
        data and visualizations created as part of the analysis, as well as explanations and
        descriptions of any trends and correlations witnessed.
